                I am a Full Stack developer from Minneapolis. I've also been doing web development as a freelancer since 2008. 
                In 2007, I won FBLA's Web Development competition for the state of Florida.
            </p>

                I've been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember. My first exposure to development happened 
                when I was 8 or 9 - my parents gave me their old computer, a Windows 95 machine, because they had just bought a 
                new one. It did not have a connection to the Internet, so I just played with everything that was already installed. 
                One of the programs that was included was Microsoft FrontPage - a visual developing environment that required no 
                programming ability. I would drag elements on to a page, then look at the source code to see what had changed. I 
                learned HTML and CSS that way. I learned JavaScript mostly by reading the source code from Temporary Internet Files. 
                Most of my practices were bad, but over the years I've caught and corrected many of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since those first years, I've learned a lot of other, non-web languages, but I've never forgotten my first love: web 
                development. Hire me as your next developer!
